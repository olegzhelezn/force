FORCE v. 3.10.04
================

Release: 24.11.2025

**Read through the changelog of :ref:`v3900` closely. In this version, there are some important changes that may affect your workflows!**

- **FORCE L2PS**

    - Vincent Schut reported that in some cases, the ``force-l2ps`` tool would 
      cancel processing of Landsat data as water vapour could not be retreived 
      from the LUT. The "error" only occured when processing coastal scenes.
      It turned out that the LUT reading function (v. >= 3.9.0) computed the
      center y-coordinate of the image incorrectly, such that the water vapour 
      from the row to the north was used instead. This caused an issue in coastal
      scenes where no LUT value is available over water. Note though, that the
      wrong LUT value was used for every scene! This has been fixed now.
      However, also note that the neighboring LUT value is surely not that far off
      the correct one, so the impact on the final results should be minimal 
      (especially for the newer OLI sensors).
      Thanks Vincent for reporting this issue. 
      Thanks to Katja Kowalski for confirming the issue.
