FORCE v. 3.10.03
===============

Release: 18.11.2025

**Read through the changelog of :ref:`v3900` closely. In this version, there are some important changes that may affect your workflows!**

- **FORCE HLPS/AUX**

    - Reading the new datacube-definition.prj format failed when spaces were present in the values.
      This can especially happen for PROJECTION definitions.
      The reading function has been updated to properly handle spaces in values.
      Thanks to reva1804 and pleitebier for reporting this issue.
