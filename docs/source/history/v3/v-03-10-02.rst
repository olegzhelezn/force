FORCE v. 3.10.02
================

Release: 18.11.2025

**Read through the changelog of :ref:`v3900` closely. In this version, there are some important changes that may affect your workflows!**

- **FORCE HLPS**

    - UDF and TSA-UDF submodules: If Python code is provided in UDF or TSA-UDF submodules, 
      the STREAMING option is now automatically set to FALSE. 
      A warning message is printed to inform the user about this change.
      This was already the case for R code in these submodules, but apparently some
      change in the belly of Python now necessitates to also disable streaming when 
      Python code along with a newer Python version is used (like done in the Docker containers >= v 3.9.0).
      Thanks to David Klehr for noticing this issue.
